### What are fellowships and what is membership?
Fellowships are groups owned by one person who can give life updates through the !notify command. You can join one by typing the !join command @'ing the person's fellowship you want to join or you can invite people into your fellowship with the !invite command. You can check the members of your fellowship by typing in the !getFellowship command. Membership is the list of all the fellowships you are a part of and this list can be checked by the !getMembership command.\
### Where should I start? How do I use this bot?\
If you want to go straight to tools that help you deal with addiction, then use the !track date command, the !track focus command, and the !track threshold command to set this up (type !help track for more information). If you want a group of friends to give life updates to, use the !invite command to add people to your fellowship and the !notify command to send out an update.\\
### Can I DM the bot?
Yes, it is actually encouraged that you DM the bot for all the commands that don't require mentioning a user for the command. Only use the open channel for !invite, !join, !kick, and !leave <br><br>
### Wait a sec wouldn't it be really awkward if someone noticed that you kicked them out of your fellowship on the open channel?
Yes it would, but there's only a small chance of that happening since all open channels message commands are deleted immediately after you post them and followups are DM'ed to you. Make sure you turn off @mention notifications for the channel this bot is running in.
